                    <font size="3"><p>Have you ever looked back on your life and thought about that one key moment that completely changed you and shaped who you are as a person today? For me, that key moment was entering high school. I believe that the competitive and foreign environment really pushed me to my limits and brought out a level of determination, perseverance, and diligence that I never knew I had. Additionally, the friendships and experiences that I’ve acquired through high school are things I will cherish for years to come. I want to talk about my journey and I why I believe that facing adversity and stepping outside of your comfort zone are essential to building your character.
<br />
<br />
Growing up, I’ve always lived a relatively comfortable and stable life. I attended the same elementary school from junior kindergarten to eight grade. I only ever moved houses once when I was three years old. Whenever my parents suggested moving houses I strongly opposed it for fear of losing my friends. Ultimately, this stubbornness had a negative impact on me since I ended up getting used to my current lifestyle which made me more reluctant to try new things.
<br />
<br />
The academic environment was also a limiting factor for me. I barely had to put in any effort to achieve high marks, and I was the go-to guy for my classmates whenever they didn’t understand something. There was no competition for me and no incentive for me to work hard. This caused me to have the view that I was better than my peers and also made me less willing to take risks in class since I felt that I was the perfect student who everyone looked up to.
<br />
<br />
All of this was turned upside down when high school rolled around. Instead of going to my local school where most of my friends were going I went to another school to take the IB program.
<br />
<br />
High school was completely different from elementary school. Suddenly, I was thrust into an incredibly competitive environment where I was no longer the top student, but an average one at best. The worst part for me was that there was not a single familiar face around with whom I could talk. I felt lost, scared, and alone.
<br />
<br />
I soon realized that I needed to put in the effort to make new friends and do well in my classes. Initially, it was challenging for me to meet new people since I’m an introverted person and I had never been the “new kid” at school. Over time, I became more comfortable with talking to strangers and ended up making a few close friends. My coursework was also much more difficult and my peers were all academically gifted. Additionally, most of my peers possessed talents like public speaking and leadership which I lacked. This motivated me to work harder and I found that this was very humbling for me. While in some classes like Mathematics I did well, in other classes like English I struggled. This allowed me to self-reflect on my strengths and weaknesses and acknowledge that I wasn’t the best at everything.
<br />
<br />
I think that if I had gone to my local school with most of my friends instead, I would’ve stayed with the same group of friends instead of trying to form new relationships and develop my social skills. I also wouldn’t have been in such a competitive environment, meaning that I wouldn’t have worked as hard in school.
<br />
<br />
I guess that if you were to take away something from this story, it would be that facing hardships and stepping outside of your comfort zone will end up benefitting you in the long run. Whether you’re moving schools, or learning a new language, the only way you will ever grow and become a better person is if you challenge yourself to face difficult situations. As the emperor from <i>Mulan</i> said, “The flower that blooms in adversity is the most rare and beautiful of all.”</p>
