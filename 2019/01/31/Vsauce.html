<p>Vsauce is a YouTube channel with 14 million subscribers run by host Michael Stevens. On the channel, he explores various fields of study ranging from physics to economics, asking thought-provoking questions like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xc4xYacTu-E" target="_blank">"Which Way Is Down?"</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTvcpdfGUtQ" target="_blank">"What Is The Speed of Dark?"</a> Such questions lead to captivating discussions from which I've learned a plethora of interesting facts and lessons. Here are 10 things Vsauce has taught me that you can bring up the next time you're at a party.
<br />
<br />
<h1> 1. The Egyptian Pyramids and the Ancient Romans </h1>

<br />
<br />
The Egyptian Pyramids were as old to the Ancient Romans as the Ancient Romans are to us. The Pyramids were constructed at around 2550BC while the Roman Empire lasted from about 753BC to 476AD. Considering the fact that humans have been around for about 200,000 years, it truly allows you to appreciate how far we've come as a species in recent years in terms of technology and culture.

<h1> 2. Wisdom of the Crowds </h1>

<br />
<br />
The Wisdom of the Crowds is a phenomenon where averaging a set of data taken from many different individuals yields a more accurate result than a single individual working alone. One example of this is when the BBC conducted an experiment where 160 people guessed the number of jelly beans in a jar. When these guesses were averaged, the result was merely five jelly beans off from the actual number. I also noticed this phenomenon in my chemistry class when we had to calculate the equilibrium constant for a chemical reaction. After averaging the values from each person in our class, the result was very close to the theoretical value. It's humbling to know that the errors of other people in a group can help balance and correct our own shortcomings.

<h1> 3. What future humans will miss </h1>
<p><img src="/images/SolarEclipse.jpg" width="700" height="447" alt="Total Solar Eclipse" />

<p><font size="5" color="grey">Source: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uiv6tKtoKg" target="_blank">What Will We Miss?</a></font>
<br />
<br />
Although, as Michael points in the video, modern humans will miss out on things like technological advancements or supernovas (unless we can somehow extend our lifespan for thousands of years), future humans won't be able to experience some of the things we take for granted. For instance, the Moon is moving away from Earth at about 1cm every year, meaning that in about 63 million years, total solar eclipses will no longer be possible. In the year 52,000, Niagra Falls will no longer exist because the water will have erroded the top of the falls all the way to Lake Erie. So although it may be disappointing that we're limited by our short lifespans, we should cherish what we have.

<h1> 4. The mere-exposure effect </h1>

<br />
<br />
Have you ever wondered why you don't like the way you look in photos? This could be caused by the mere-exposure effect, which is when we develop a preference for the things we are familiar with. When we see ourselves, we often look at our reflection in the mirror. However, a mirror laterally inverts the image it reflects, meaning that what you see in the mirror is different from what cameras and other people see. To see the effect this can have, look at the two images above. The one on the left shows Abraham Lincoln as seen from a camera, but the one of the right shows the mirrored image that Lincoln himself was used to seeing.

<h1> 5. Computer screens don't show true colour </h1>

<p><font size="5" color="grey">Source: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3unPcJDbCc" target="_blank">This Is Not Yellow</a></font>
<br />
<br />
When you see something yellow like a banana, you are seeing light with a wavelength of about 570nm. However, if you are looking at yellow on a computer screen, you are not seeing "true" yellow. This is because each pixel on a screen can only produce red, green, or blue light. Despite this, a screen can still fool you into seeing other colours. The human retina contains three types of cone cells which are each suited to detect a certain colour. One detects red, another detects green, and the third detects blue. The wavelength for yellow length is between the wavelengths for green and red light, so when you see "true" yellow both the green and red cones are activated which is interpreted as yellow. To simulate yellow light, a screen can show some green and red light since the pixels are too small to individually distinguish.

<h1> 6. Astronauts are not weightless </h1>

<br />
<br />
It's a common misconception that astronauts aboard space shuttles or the ISS experience zero gravity, allowing them to float around. Astronauts on the ISS actually experience about 90% of the gravity people on Earth do. The reason they are able to float is because they are in a state of freefall. The ISS orbits the Earth at around 28,000km/h, which is fast enough that the ISS falls to Earth at the same rate that the Earth curves away from it, creating a feeling of weightlessness. 

<h1> 7. Zipf's law </h1>

<p><font size="5" color="grey">Source: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCn8zs912OE" target="_blank">The Zipf Mystery</a></font>
<br />
<br />
Zipf's law is a phenomenon in language where the number of times a word occurs in a text can be approximated with its frequency rank. This means that the second most common word will occur about half as many times as the most common word, the third most common word will occur about a third as many times as the most common word, and so on. Plotting a graph with of the log of the frequency against the log of the rank will yield a linear plot as shown above. This has been observed in all languages, but is not limited to linguistics. As Michael mentions, Zipf's law is present in city populations, the amount of traffic websites receive, earthquake magnitudes, and more. The crazy thing is that we have no idea why this occurs.

<h1> 8. Blindsight </h1>
<p><img src="/images/Blindsight.jpg" width="720" height="405" alt="Person with blindsight" />

<p><font size="5" color="grey">Source: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSf8i8bHIns" target="_blank">What is Déjà vu?</a></font>
<br />
<br />
The human brain contains a visual cortex which receives information from the retinas, allowing us to see. Information from the retina is also sent to the amygdala, which processes emotions, and the tectum, which is involved with preliminary visual processing. This means that people who have become blind because of damage to the visual cortex are still able to unconsciously process visual information. Despite being completely blind, these individuals are able to avoid obstacles on the ground and can feel emotion when presented with images of different human facial expressions. This is known as blindsight and it reveals a lot about the subconscious part of the human brain.

<h1> 9. It's impossible to literally touch something </h1>
<p><img src="/images/Touch.png" width="700" height="393" alt="Representation of sitting down" />
  <br /><font size="2" color="black">Credit: Vsauce</font>
  
<p><font size="5" color="grey">Source: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yE8rkG9Dw4s" target="_blank">You Can't Touch Anything</a></font>
<br />
<br />
When we think of two objects as touching, we would think that there would be no space between them. At an atomic level however, there will always be a gap because electrons in atoms repel each other. This means that when you sit down, you are technically hovering over the chair. In order to be as close as possible to touching, atoms must chemically react with each other by sharing electrons. Knowing this, we can say with certainty that the people who you have been the closest to touching are your parents and children. This is because your mother and father's DNA reacts in the womb to create you. And that's touching (pun intended).

<h1> 10. Regrets are like carvings on a tree </h1>
<p><img src="/images/TreeCarving.jpg" width="750" height="500" alt="Tree Carving" />

<br />
<br />
I absolutely love this metaphor from Ze Frank that Michael shares when talking about our past. Think of regrets and bad memories as carvings on a tree. The carvings won't go away or fade and they'll remain in their original spot forever. Pretty depressing right? Well, the tree itself doesn't have to be held down by these carvings. It can continue growing, becoming taller and gaining new branches. The regret may not get smaller, but you can make it a smaller part of yourself. So whenever you're lamenting over a failed test or a breakup, just remember that, like a tree, you can grow to make that experience something insignificantly small.

<p>I hope these facts were as interesting and mind-blowing to you as they were to me. If you want to learn more, I highly recommend that you check out <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC6nSFpj9HTCZ5t-N3Rm3-HA" target="_blank">Vsauce</a> on YouTube.
